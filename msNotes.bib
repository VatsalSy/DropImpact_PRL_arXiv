@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" We note that in singular cases the first impact peak need not be the largest: As our recent studies \cite {sanjayzhang2022prl,sanjay2024inertia} have indicated, under very specific conditions ($Oh \sim \protect \mathcal  {O}(10^{-3})$, $We \approx 9$), a second impact peak -- after droplet recoil and connected to the bouncing up of the droplet -- can exceed the first one due to a hydrodynamic singularity. For our considerations here it is not relevant. "}
